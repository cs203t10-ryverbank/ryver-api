# Ryver Bank API

The Ryver Bank API is built as a collection of microservices.

# Cloning all microservices

To clone all microservices, first initialize all submodules.

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will pull the correct version of each microservice for the current deployment.
